# Unity Photon Quantum WebGPU Tech-Demo and Playground

This demo was created to see how Photon Quantum and WebGPU behave together, and to answer the following questions:
- Is it possible to create, use and synchronize a large number of dynamic Photon Quantum entities.
- Is it possible to render a large number of static Photon Quantum Entities using Graphics.RenderMeshInstanced.
- Does it make sense to add bucking systems to such a rendering.
- How effective are these methods compared to classic rendering.

### How To Install
Replace "App Id Quantum" in Assets/QuantumUser/Resources/PhotonServerSettings.asset
